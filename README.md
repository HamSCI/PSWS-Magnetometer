# PSWS-Magnetometer
Software and Design Files for the Personal Space Weather Station Magnetometer

This repository contains separate trees for the PSWS Open Source remote and local magnetometer support hardware projects.

For now, these are simply ZIPped versions of the most recent KiCAD project folders. To use one or the other, just download the project ZIP that you want.  Then expand it in your favorite workspace. Then just open KiCAD and use File > OpenProject menu option to navigate into the folder and select the '*.kicad_pro' file for the project.

These are currently being created using KiCAD 7.07 on Mint Linux 21.2 Cinnamon.
